Following bouts of poor health, he dedicated himself to writing, publishing travel books and a three-volume biography of Jefferson Davis, although his sympathetic portrayal of Davis drew mixed responses. Strode's teaching career spanned twenty-five years, during which he mentored aspiring writers and helped them secure publishing opportunities. He received notable recognition, including a knighthood from King Gustav Adolf of Sweden, and retired in 1963 but continued writing until his later years. The Hoole Special Collections Library at the University of Alabama holds a collection of his papers.","Strode, Hudson",":

Despite his color-blindness, which prompted a shift from painting to sculpture, Rayford expanded his creative repertoire to encompass poetry and literature. Throughout his career, he engaged in diverse experiences, including studying at Duke University, apprenticing with the renowned sculptor Gutzon Borglum, and contributing to the war effort during World War II. Rayford's artistic legacy extended beyond his literary works and performances, as he created sculptures for local organizations and played an active role in preserving and promoting Mobile's cultural heritage.","Rayford, Julian Lee","s;

After working as a printer's apprentice for his father's newspaper, Hooper pursued a legal career in Alabama, eventually joining his brother's practice in LaFayette. His stories gained national attention when they were republished by the Spirit of the Times, with his most famous character, Captain Simon Suggs, making his debut. Hooper's humorous stories, often featuring Suggs, were compiled in a book in 1845. Throughout his career, Hooper also worked as an editor for various newspapers and held political positions, including serving as the Solicitor of the Ninth Judicial Circuit in Alabama. His involvement in politics continued as he supported the Know-Nothing Party and later embraced secession. In 1861, Hooper was appointed as the secretary to the Southern Congress, but his life was tragically cut short by illness, likely tuberculosis, in 1862.","Hooper, Johnson Jones","s;

After finding initial success with his short story ""Miriam,"" published in Mademoiselle, Capote further established himself through his debut novel, Other Voices, Other Rooms. He ventured into various forms of writing, including travel articles, celebrity profiles, stage adaptations, and screenplays. Capote's most notable work, In Cold Blood, a groundbreaking nonfiction novel inspired by a true crime story, brought him both acclaim and challenges. Despite ongoing struggles with substance abuse, Capote continued writing but faced diminishing success and strained relationships with his celebrity acquaintances. His unfinished work, Answered Prayers, published in parts, caused controversy and further isolated him from his former social circle. Eventually, his declining health, exacerbated by substance abuse, led to his passing in 1984.","Capote, Truman",":
