With a keen interest in drama from a young age, Strode actively participated in theatrical activities and pursued his education at the University of Alabama, where he later became an English literature and public speaking instructor. While World War I exempted him from military service, Strode organized troop entertainment during this period. Following bouts of poor health, he dedicated himself to writing, publishing travel books and a three-volume biography of Jefferson Davis, although his sympathetic portrayal of Davis drew mixed responses. Strode's teaching career spanned twenty-five years, during which he mentored aspiring writers and helped them secure publishing opportunities. He received notable recognition, including a knighthood from King Gustav Adolf of Sweden, and retired in 1963 but continued writing until his later years.

Stribling, born in Clifton, Tennessee, grew up in an environment immersed in journalism and later worked in his parents' general store. While he aspired to become a writer, Stribling initially pursued a career in teaching, studying at Southern Normal College and the State Normal College. However, his true passion for writing prevailed, and he transitioned to full-time writing after a brief stint in law and journalism. Stribling's early works encompassed children's stories and adventure tales, but his breakthrough came with his novel, <em>Birthright</em>, published in 1922. Notably, his renowned trilogy comprising <em>The Forge</em>, <em>The Store</em>, and <em>Unfinished Cathedral</em> depicted the fortunes and decline of the fictional Vaiden family of Florence. While Stribling continued to write a mix of popular and serious novels until 1938, his later years saw him primarily focusing on publishing short stories in magazines until his retirement in 1955.</span></p>","Stribling, T.S.",http://encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1834^^https://apps.lib.ua.edu/blogs/this-goodly-land/author/?AuthorID=37,"<em>Alabama Authors</em>, edited by Beverley Park Rilett, http://AlabamaAuthors.org",1881-1965,,,"Thomas Sigismund Stribling: full name^^Gravelly Springs, Lauderdale County: home of maternal relativesFlorence, Lauderdale County: education, brief adult residence, setting for three of his novels Tuscaloosa, Tuscaloosa County: education, brief adult residence^^Pulitzer Prize, Novel, 1933, for <em>The Store</em> uilefordincluded in <em>O.

Sullivan introduced Keller to manual sign language, enabling her to grasp the concept of symbolic representation. With Sullivan's guidance, Keller acquired the ability to speak and comprehend multiple languages, leading her to pursue higher education and obtain a Bachelor of Arts degree from Radcliffe College in 1904. Keller's remarkable journey fueled her lifelong commitment to social reform, advocating for the rights and education of disabled individuals and championing causes such as women's suffrage and labor unions. Her humanitarian contributions were recognized through numerous accolades, including the Legion of Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Despite her limited interest in formal education, she graduated from Sidney Lanier High School in 1918. After meeting F. Scott Fitzgerald at a local dance, the couple embarked on a whirlwind romance, leading to their marriage in 1920. Immersed in the vibrant literary and social milieu of New York City, they became emblematic figures of the Jazz Age. Zelda's own writing contributions on ""Flappers"" were published alongside Scott's work. However, their lives were marked by constant travels between Europe and the United States. Zelda explored various artistic pursuits such as painting and ballet but faced mental health challenges and was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1930. Despite her ongoing struggles, she continued writing and completed her novel, Save Me the Waltz, while in psychiatric care. Tragically, Zelda's life was cut short in 1948 when she perished in a fire at Highland Hospital.</span></p>","Fitzgerald, Zelda",http://encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1120^^https://apps.lib.ua.edu/blogs/this-goodly-land/author/?AuthorID=109,"<em>Alabama Authors</em>, edited by Beverley Park Rilett, http://AlabamaAuthors.org",1900-1948,,,"Zelda Sayre: birth name^^Montgomery, Montgomery County: birthplace, childhood residence, adult residence^^^^Bruccoli, Matthew J., Scottie Fitzgerald Smith, and Joan P.
